ðŸ”„ Bronze Layer Implementation Completed

  This update covers the full implementation of the bronze layer in the SQL Serverâ€“based data warehouse. Key steps included:
  
      -Analyzing source data context, structure, and access methods
      
      -Creating raw staging tables under the bronze schema
      
      -Using BULK INSERT for efficient loading from CSV source files
      
      -Truncating target tables before each load to ensure clean full loads
      
      -Wrapping the logic in a reusable bronze.load_bronze stored procedure
      
      -Performing basic data validation (row counts, column alignment)
  
  This forms the foundational step in the warehouse architecture, enabling a reliable pipeline for raw data ingestion.
